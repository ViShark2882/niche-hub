It’s a tool, and it does its job well. But the reason I got into photography in the first place was not to use a tool, but because I love photography. Film has been making a comeback for the past several years, and I thought that it was something I’d like to try."

Somewhat annoyingly the powers that be have decided not to migrate data from the old platform; said platform has been somewhat hobbled for the past couple of months anyway, but now is an excellent time to take a look at the stats over the years before they're gone for good!</p><p>I started uploading to iStockphoto in 2003. A lot has changed - I’m not even 100% certain I wasn't still on dial up in the UK, if not I was certainly on my first cable modem with 600Kbits/s symmetric (and wow did I think that was the dogs dangalies back then...)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Uploads over the years - growing portfolio</h3><p><img alt=""portfolio size"" src=""https://microstockinsider.com/files/portfoliosize.png"" style=""width: 483px; height: 292px;"" /></p><p>Total is cumulative and the upper line (sorry about the colours here).

I don't curate my portfolio once uploaded (to make the playing field level for all agencies to compare).</p><p>I don't have an easy way of calculating RPI for a rolling window of images uploaded in the previous 3 or 5 years, I think that might be a more useful statistic and less prone to error.</p><p>Hopefully there is something here to compare your own results with.

Sep-Nov are good months for me as is commonly seen in the industry. <strong>I think this is actually quite important as it could make the RPI at istock constant over the past 3 years.</strong><br />&nbsp;</li></ol>         <br />                <p>For latest updates check our <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/StockPhotographers"">facebook</a> and <a href=""http://twitter.com/microstockin"">twitter</a> pages.</p>                <a href=""http://microstockinsider.com/guides/advertise"">Advertise Here</a>            <br />"
